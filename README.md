# Book management API

The API and JavaScript code in this repository are part of a take home assignment.

## How to run the application

First of all, please run **mvn clean install** so that all packages can be retrieved.

The application can be run with the **mvn spring-boot:run** command inside a terminal window, or by opening the project in an IDE like IntelliJ and running it from there.

## How to run the JavaScript client-side code

The client code can be run with the **node client.js** command inside a terminal window, or by opening the project in an IDE like IntelliJ, locating the file and running it from there.

## Postman collection

I have also included a Postman collection which contains all of the API calls that can be handled by this application.
